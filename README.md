This network is a extremely simple perceptron network that was written in C.
This is my first attempt of creating a neural network from scratch without any references,
So I apologies for any oversights and logical issues in the process.

Currently NOT gate is Not based on a perceptron. I'm kinda struggling in adjusting bias values for the NOT gate. I'll figure it out and implement that correctly.
